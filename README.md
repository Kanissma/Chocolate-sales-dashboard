# Chocolate-sales-dashboard
I have created an interactive sales dashboard for the chocolate business in Microsoft Power BI, containing multiple charts that describe chocolate sales by Area, salesperson performance, and total revenue.

## Project Objective:
The store wants to create a sales dashboard for the period from January 2023 to September 2024. So that management can understand the Sales of the product and the performance of the salesperson for a particular time frame.
